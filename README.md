# Quantum-Measurement-any-basis-and-check-QEC

This repository is all about how to take the measurement in any basis. I am using QISKit for code and the main issue i was facing during the measurement is you cannot measure the qubit other than X, Y and Z basis but my code will help you to measurement the qubit in any basis. Secondl issue which is i took is :  how to check which quantum code will resolve the all Pauli error with the help of Stabilizers . There is always a scope of  improvement ,looking forward for any feedback.
